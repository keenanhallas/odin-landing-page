# odin-landing-page

## Initial thoughts:

The goal of this project is to create a landing page from scratch, starting with a blank repo, and based on the provided design files (included in this repo). The MVP is simply to have a page that looks relatively close to the design file, and is sufficiently responsive in a web browser - not to create a pixel-perfect match or have a page that looks correct on mobile devices.

The intention here is to put to use all of the fundamental aspects of HTML & CSS that have been covered so far in the Odin Project Foundations Course. Starting out, I see the key areas of focus being:

    - Building a page from the ground up, using a blank repo, to simulate a more "real-world" scenario
    - Practicing how to break down a design doc into smaller chunks that can be created one by one without being overwhelming
    - Starting to develop a workflow working with both HTML & CSS - moving from structure first into styling
    - Practicing using Google when I encounter something that hasn't been touched yet in the course material
    - Using normal flow or Flexbox at different levels of the element tree, depending on which is most appropriate
    - Starting to identify common design patterns used in various components that may be repeated across many different sites
    - Solidifying my knowledge of basic HTML & CSS before moving on to the start of the JS content and the rest of the Odin Project curriculum
